# TexSoup

Parses valid LaTeX and provides a variety of BeautifulSoup-esque methods and Pythonic idioms for iterating and searching the parse tree. Unlike BeautifulSoup
however, TexSoup is modeled after an interpreter, providing a set of Pythonic
structures for processing environments, commands, and arguments in anticipation
of integration with a CAS.
